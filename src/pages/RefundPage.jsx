            <h2>Return Policy</h2>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring your satisfaction with any merchandise you have ordered from us. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may initiate a return within 7 days from the date of delivery.</p>
            <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, in the same condition that you received it, and in its original packaging. You will also need to provide a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item.</p>
            <p>If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies, typically 5-7 business days.</p>

            <h2>Cancellations</h2>
            <p>You can cancel your order before the item has been shipped. If you cancel your order before shipment, your payment will be fully refunded to your original payment method. If the item has already been shipped, you will need to follow the Return Policy.</p>

            <h2>Shipping Costs for Returns</h2>
            <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item unless the item received was defective or incorrect. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping may be deducted from your refund.</p>
